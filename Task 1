# ASSUMPTIONS:
# The assumption is made that the input file 
# contains a valid format where each line has either 
# "JUMP" or "JOIN" as the first word, followed by the 
# name of the person as the second word. There are no 
# additional words or formatting variations in the lines.


# The assumption is made that the input file exists and can be
# successfully opened for reading.


# The assumption is made that the names of the people in
# the queue do not contain any leading or trailing spaces.


# The assumption is made that the order of names in the 
# output file does not need to be sorted or modified in any particular way."""
